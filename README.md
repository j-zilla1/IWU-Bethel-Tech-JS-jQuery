# IWU-Bethel-Tech-JS-jQuery

This is an example of using <b>jQuery</b> to create a responsive page. Upon hover, the unordered list items enlarge and change font. There is a clearly marked section that upon click, expands and gives a definition for <b>jQuery</b>. Upon hover, the header changes colors. There is a very basic form that uses the keydown function to change the color of the input text. More expansions on this particular project to come.
